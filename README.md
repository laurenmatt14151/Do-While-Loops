# Do-While-Loops
Using do-while loops to perform 6 steps:

1. Prompt the user to input two integers: firstNum and secondNum (firstNum must be less than secondNum).
2. Output all odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
3. Output the sum of all even numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
4. Output the numbers and their squares between 1 and 10. Separate the numbers by any amount of spaces.
5. Output the sum of the square of the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum.
6. Output all uppercase letters.
